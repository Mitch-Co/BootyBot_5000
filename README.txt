What is BootyBot 5000?

Booty Bot is a discord bot written in discord.js. 
It can analyze server messages and provide statistics on various server metrics.
There is no reason why it is called BootyBot, I just could not think of a suitable name.

Currently the functionality of BootyBot is slim, but it has been developed to allow for easy expansion.

All code is stored within the JS folder, with main logic code being stored in BootyBot.js.
All BootyBot commands are stored as modules in the commands folder.

Each important folder location has its own readme.txt.

GETTING STARTED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run BootyBot - Install Node JS, install the discord js node module in the JS folder.
Replace the exampleconfig.json in the assets folder with your custom config.json file.

Now, to start BootyBot, all that is required is to run BootyBot.js with Node.
