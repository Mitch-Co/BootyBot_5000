## What is BootyBot 5000?

Booty Bot 5000 is a discord bot written in [discord.js](https://discord.js.org). It can analyze server messages and provide statistics on various server metrics. There is no reason why it is called BootyBot, I just could not think of a suitable name.<br/>
A major rewrite of BootyBot had to be done after discovering that JSON object saving and reading works just slightly differently than expected. Some code could have allowed for a hacky fix, but a rewrite seemed more appropriate. 
## Getting Started
To run Booty Bot - Install Node JS, install the discord js node module in the `JS` folder.
After installation, replace the `exampleconfig.json` in the `assets` folder with your custom config.json file.
